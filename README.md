# NextJS Frontend Mentor Template

This is a minimal NextJS template to kick off [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges.

## Single Command Setup

To get started with this template, just run this command:

`npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/jrddp/frontend-mentor-nextjs-template`

## Setup GitHub Pages Autodeployment

A workflow is include to build and deploy after each push to your repository. To enable it:

- On your GitHub repository, go to 'Settings' > 'Pages'
- Under **Build and deployment**, change `Source` to `GitHub Actions`
- GitHub Actions will now automatically build and deploy as a static site with each push to your repository.

The site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`. You can see the example at [https://jrddp.github.io/frontend-mentor-nextjs-template](https://jrddp.github.io/frontend-mentor-nextjs-template).
